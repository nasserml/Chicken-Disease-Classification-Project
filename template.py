""" 
This code is used to create a project template by creating directories and files based on a predefined list. Let's break down the code:

Import the necessary modules:

os: Provides a way to interact with the operating system.
pathlib.Path: Provides a way to manipulate file and directory paths.
logging: Enables logging functionality to track progress and actions.
Set up the logging configuration to display log messages with a specific format.

Define the project_name variable, which represents the name of the project.

Define a list of files (list_of_files) that need to be created.

Iterate over each file path in the list_of_files:

Create a Path object from the file path.

Extract the directory and filename from the path using os.path.split().

If the directory is not an empty string (i.e., the file has a directory):

Create the directory using os.makedirs() if it doesn't exist.
Log a message indicating the creation of the directory.
If the file doesn't exist or is empty:

Create an empty file using open() in write mode.
Log a message indicating the creation of the empty file.
If the file already exists:

Log a message indicating that the file already exists.
This code can be used to set up a project structure quickly by automatically creating directories and files. The logging statements provide feedback on the creation process.

Iterating over each file path in the list_of_files list.
python
 
    filepath = Path(filepath)
Creating a Path object from the current file path.
python

Splitting the path into directory and filename using os.path.split().

Checking if the directory is not an empty string (i.e., the file has a directory). If it's not empty:
Creating the directory using os.makedirs() if it doesn't exist.
Logging a message indicating the creation of the directory.
