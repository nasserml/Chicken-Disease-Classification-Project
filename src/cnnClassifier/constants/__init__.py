The code snippet you provided imports the Path class from the pathlib module and defines two variables CONFIG_FILE_PATH and PARAMS_FILE_PATH.

""" 
This line imports the Path class from the pathlib module. The pathlib module provides a convenient way to work with file system paths.
This line creates a Path object named CONFIG_FILE_PATH that represents the path "config/config.yaml". The Path object is created by passing the path string as an argument to the Path constructor. This line assumes that there is a directory named "config" relative to the current working directory, and inside that directory, there is a file named "config.yaml".
This line creates a Path object named PARAMS_FILE_PATH that represents the path "params.yaml". Similarly to the previous line, the Path object is created by passing the path string as an argument to the Path constructor. This line assumes that there is a file named "params.yaml" in the current working directory.

In summary, the Path class is used to create Path objects representing file system paths. The CONFIG_FILE_PATH variable represents the path "config/config.yaml", and the PARAMS_FILE_PATH variable represents the path "params.yaml". These paths can be used later in the code to manipulate or access the corresponding files.
