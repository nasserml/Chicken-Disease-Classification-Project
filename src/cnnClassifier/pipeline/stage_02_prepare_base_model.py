""" 
The provided code represents a stage in a training pipeline for preparing a base model. Let's break it down:

It begins with importing necessary modules and dependencies, including ConfigurationManager, PrepareBaseModel, and the logger from the cnnClassifier package.

The variable STAGE_NAME is set to "Prepare base model".

The code defines a class called PrepareBaseModelTrainingPipeline, which represents the training pipeline stage for preparing the base model. The class has an empty __init__ method, indicating no specific initialization is needed.

Inside the class, there's a main method that serves as the entry point for this pipeline stage.

Within the main method, a ConfigurationManager object is instantiated to access the configuration settings.

The get_prepare_base_model_config method of the ConfigurationManager is called to retrieve the configuration specific to the prepare base model stage.

An instance of PrepareBaseModel is created, passing the retrieved configuration as an argument.

The get_base_model method of the PrepareBaseModel instance is called to obtain the base model.

The update_base_model method of the PrepareBaseModel instance is called to perform any necessary updates or modifications to the base model.

The if __name__ == '__main__': condition checks if the current file is the main entry point.

Inside this condition, a try-except block is used to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the stage.

The logger prints an information message indicating the start of the "Prepare base model" stage.

An instance of PrepareBaseModelTrainingPipeline is created.

The main method of the PrepareBaseModelTrainingPipeline instance is called to execute the stage.

The logger prints an information message indicating the completion of the "Prepare base model" stage.

If an exception occurs during the execution, the logger logs the exception details and re-raises the exception.

In summary, this code defines a training pipeline stage for preparing the base model. It retrieves the necessary configuration, creates an instance of the PrepareBaseModel class, obtains the base model, and performs any required updates. The main method of the pipeline class is then executed within a try-except block, logging the start and completion of the stage.

from cnnClassifier.config.configuration import ConfigurationManager: Imports the ConfigurationManager class from the cnnClassifier.config.configuration module.

from cnnClassifier.components.prepare_base_model import PrepareBaseModel: Imports the PrepareBaseModel class from the cnnClassifier.components.prepare_base_model module.

from cnnClassifier import logger: Imports the logger object from the cnnClassifier package.

STAGE_NAME = "Prepare base model": Assigns the string "Prepare base model" to the variable STAGE_NAME.

class PrepareBaseModelTrainingPipeline:: Defines a class named PrepareBaseModelTrainingPipeline.

def __init__(self):: Defines the __init__ method for the PrepareBaseModelTrainingPipeline class. It is empty and doesn't perform any actions.

def main(self):: Defines the main method for the PrepareBaseModelTrainingPipeline class.

config = ConfigurationManager(): Creates an instance of the ConfigurationManager class and assigns it to the variable config.

prepare_base_model_config = config.get_prepare_base_model_config(): Calls the get_prepare_base_model_config() method of the ConfigurationManager instance to retrieve the configuration specific to the prepare base model stage, and assigns it to the variable prepare_base_model_config.

prepare_base_model = PrepareBaseModel(config=prepare_base_model_config): Creates an instance of the PrepareBaseModel class, passing the prepare_base_model_config as a configuration argument, and assigns it to the variable prepare_base_model.

prepare_base_model.get_base_model(): Calls the get_base_model() method of the prepare_base_model instance to obtain the base model.

prepare_base_model.update_base_model(): Calls the update_base_model() method of the prepare_base_model instance to perform any necessary updates or modifications to the base model.

if __name__ == '__main__':: Checks if the current file is being run as the main module.

logger.info(f"*******************"): Logs an information message using the logger object.

logger.info(f">>>>>> stage {STAGE_NAME} started <<<<<<"): Logs an information message indicating the start of the "Prepare base model" stage.

obj = PrepareBaseModelTrainingPipeline(): Creates an instance of the PrepareBaseModelTrainingPipeline class and assigns it to the variable obj.

obj.main(): Calls the main() method of the obj instance to execute the main logic of the "Prepare base model" stage.

logger.info(f">>>>>> stage {STAGE_NAME} completed <<<<<<\n\nx==========x"): Logs an information message indicating the completion of the "Prepare base model" stage.

except Exception as e:: Catches any exception that occurs during the execution of the code within the try block.

logger.exception(e): Logs the exception details using the logger object.

raise e: Reraises the caught exception to propagate it further.

In summary, this code defines a class PrepareBaseModelTrainingPipeline with a main method that retrieves the necessary configuration, creates an instance of the PrepareBaseModel class, obtains the base model, and performs any required updates. The code then checks if it is being run as the main module and executes the main logic within a try-except block. Information messages are logged before and after the execution, and any exceptions are caught, logged, and re-raised.
