#The provided code is a Dockerfile, which is used to build a Docker image for running a Python application.
#
#FROM python:3.8-slim-buster: This line specifies the base image for the Docker image. In this case, it uses the official Python 3.8 slim-buster image from Docker Hub. This image includes a minimal installation of Python 3.8 on top of the Debian Buster operating system.
#
#RUN apt update -y && apt install awscli -y: This line uses the RUN instruction to execute commands inside the Docker container during the build process. In this case, it updates the package repositories (apt update -y) and installs the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) tool (apt install awscli -y) using the package manager (apt) available in the base image.
#
#WORKDIR /app: This line sets the working directory within the Docker container to /app. It means that all subsequent instructions will be executed in this directory.
#
#COPY . /app: This line copies the contents of the current directory (where the Dockerfile is located) into the /app directory inside the Docker container. It allows you to transfer your application code and files into the image.
#
#RUN pip install -r requirements.txt: This line installs the Python dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file using pip. The requirements.txt file should be present in the same directory as the Dockerfile, and it typically contains a list of required Python packages along with their versions.
#
#CMD ["python3", "app.py"]: This line specifies the default command to be executed when a container is created from the image. It runs the Python script app.py using the python3 interpreter. This command will be overridden if the user specifies a different command when running the container.
#
#In summary, this Dockerfile sets up a Docker image based on the Python 3.8 slim-buster image, installs the AWS CLI tool, copies the application code into the container, installs the Python dependencies, and specifies the default command to run the app.py script. This image can be built and used to run a Python application within a Docker container, along with any required dependencies and tools.
